# Machine-Learning-Project-Hardware-Dataset
* The goal of this project is to training my own habilities in data analisys and model buildings, first in Regressions.
* The models used on this repository are Linear Regression,Ridge and Lasso Regression, KNeighbors Regression and a simples Neural Network Regressor from sklearn.
* I do not own the data used on this repository.
* Machine Learning project on the dataset available in public domain.
* Dataset link Available on the main Ipython.
* Feel free to clone this repository.
